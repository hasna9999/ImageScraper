# ImageScraper :
Scraping script using python3 and urllib, it downloads all images in a given website.

# description :
this script has two classes first one gets a max amount of urls  (the variable max_urls = 50 ) and second class searches each url and downloads every picture in that webpage.

# my motivations :
improve my python skills and share something that could be usefull for others :)

# how to use the script:
    1. First you shold verrify that you have all the dipendencies , and by dipendencies i mean python3 and the libraries imported in top of the script "imageScraper.py" 
    2. how to execute the script:
    * get into the folder containing the script 
    ```
    cd ImageScraper
    ```
    * then execute the script (inside the script change the target website the variable <'site =  "https://www.example.com"'> by your own target or you can just test with the given website "https://www.florajet.com/", if you want to encrease results change the value of 'max_urls' to a higher number )
    ```python
    python3 imageScraper.py
    ```
    * you can stop the script using ctrl+c or ctrl+z



# limites of the script and in case it doesn't work:

some website could detect the scraper i already bypassed that using some proxies and headers but i could not put that in the repo since it's not very legal, 
so if it doesn't work on your target you should be ashamed of what you are doing!!
